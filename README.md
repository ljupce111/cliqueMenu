# Project TODOs

## Completed
- [x] Fix cards UI
- [x] Change the JS for the item modal (update for dietary info)

## Quick / Easy
- [ ] Fix modal UI
- [ ] Put the correct links in the social icons
- [ ] Remove either the vegan or the vegetarian filter (no need for both)
- [ ] Add hover effects on cards/buttons
- [ ] Add the Clique phone number to the site
- [ ] Display a message `"No items"` if there are no items in the category

## Medium / Moderate
- [ ] Make the main element fill the whole viewport height so that when there are no items the footer is not visible until scrolling
- [ ] On mobile, when scrolling through items, only the category buttons and filter buttons stick to the top; the header does not
- [ ] On the category buttons and filter buttons container:
  - [ ] On PC: when the window is too small to fit all buttons, show arrows to scroll left/right
  - [ ] On mobile: allow scrolling with a small arrow indicator
- [ ] Adapt site layout and UI for mobile
- [ ] Option to make an item unavailable (show a warning on the item card that it’s unavailable)
- [ ] Add “Extras” category

## Bigger / Complex
- [ ] Store menu items in JSON files (either in the project folder or hosted externally)
- [ ] Build an admin panel for managing menu items
- [ ] Add multi-language support
