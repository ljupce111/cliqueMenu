# Project TODOs

## Completed
- [x] Fix cards UI
- [x] Change the JS for the item modal (update for dietary info)
- [x] Fix modal UI
- [x] Remove either the vegan or the vegetarian filter (no need for both)
- [x] Put the correct links in the social icons
- [x] Add the Clique phone number to the site
- [x] Display a message `"No items"` if there are no items in the category
- [x] Add hover effects on cards/buttons
- [x] Add an icon for the iphone store app too

## Medium / Moderate
- [ ] On mobile, when scrolling through items, only the category buttons and filter buttons stick to the top; the header does not
- [ ] On the category buttons and filter buttons container:
  - [ ] On PC: when the window is too small to fit all buttons, show arrows to scroll left/right
  - [ ] On mobile: allow scrolling with a small arrow indicator
- [ ] Adapt site layout and UI for mobile
- [ ] Option to make an item unavailable (show a warning on the item card that it’s unavailable)
- [ ] Add “Extras” category
- [ ] make the cards be horizontali longer when in mobile mode so it can fit more items in the full vh of the phone
- [ ] add unavailable items ui

## Bigger / Complex
- [ ] Store menu items in JSON files (either in the project folder or hosted externally)
- [ ] Build an admin panel for managing menu items
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] possible idea to think about make it so on mobile when the user scrolls instead of just passing the item it locks on to the item when the user ligthly scrolls
